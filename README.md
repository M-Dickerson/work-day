# Work Day

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to fix an already existing scheduler that wouldn't save the text entered into the text fields. It also solves the problem of the text field colors not changing as the time changes. I learned more about local storage, as well as using jQuery in place of javascript to do basic functions.

## Usage
